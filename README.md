# menu-searcher
A simple repository and search tool to log menu scrapbook contents and print an index.

Written in python and using tkinter as a the GUI for a windows environment. 

I have a lot of collected recipes in scrapbooks and wanted to index them and search them by keyword or main ingredient. 
This code could be adapted for other kinds of scrapbooks. 

Finally got it working, I learned a lot on the way, this is version 1
